								<p>Hi Saran, Now that you're back home, I must thank you for the wonderful trip that you organized for us in Tanzania. Other than the leopard, we got to see practically every other animal. The Ngorongoro Crater which had been such a source of fascination for me lived up to its promise. And Manosi, as you know, did get the see the migration and the river crossing. So we're both very happy.</p>
<p>A special word for Azaria: he was just amazing &ndash; knowledgeable, considerate, keen to take us to spots where there was the possibility of 'action'. Both Manosi and I have put up our reviews on Tripadvisor and we've mentioned him. I think we're exceptionally lucky that he was assigned to us.</p>
<p>My sister-in-law and one of my close friends in Delhi have expressed interest in doing the same trip. I'm hoping they'll follow through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, once again.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

								<p>The Earth Safari organised our visit to Kenya during the second week of July which is the peak season. We were received and greeted by Joyce at the airport who made us instantly feel at home. As advised by Saran, we spent three nights at Masai Maara and one night at lake Nakuru and true to his word, we had the best sightings of the Big 5.</p>
<p>Our stay at all three places were extremely comfortable in high quality lodges located right in the heart of the reserves. We had children and elderly people in the family and the staff at all these hotels were very helpful and caring. The guide Max who was with us throughout the trip was very well informed and knew exactly how to get the best sighting. This was extremely important for a keen photographer like me.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Saran and his team for organizing such a great holiday. We will surely be planning more holidays with The Earth Safari in the future.</p>							</div>

								<p>Hi Saran,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a ton for organizing our Kenya Trip ( 23 Jun - 30 Jun 2018). It was extremely well planned and meticulously organised. We all had a very enjoyable and memorable holiday. .Highlights of the trip was great sightings of "The Big Five" and bonus of a Leopard with a kill and Lions mating . Heartfelt appreciation for taking into consideration all our preferences and special requirements and honoring all that was committed.Here goes a brief Review....&nbsp;</p>
<p>Itinerary- Fully customised with maximum Game drives and activities as per our preferences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accommodation - Stayed in Ol Tukai Lodge (Amboseli ),The Ark (Aberdare) , Sarova Lion Hill Lodge (Lake Nakuru) and Ashnil Mara Camp ( Masai Mara).All the accommodation ( rooms / tents) were luxurious and well maintained to say the least.Staff were extremely courteous and caring in all the lodges and camps.They really made us feel pampered and special.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vehicle - Was provided a 4x4 Toyata Land Cruiser as requested . Vehicle was well maintained and clean with a pop up roof , binoculars , adequate charging points and a cool box with packaged drinking water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driver cum Guide - Our driver cum guide was Patrick Ndura ... a middle aged gentleman with years of experience and expertise in his trade.He was extremely soft spoken with a great sense of humor but a stickler to the rules of the jungle which we all appreciated and respected.He knew the vast jungles and Savannah of Kenya like the back of his hands.With his experience he always managed to predict the routes that would be taken by the Cheetahs and Lions and would position the vehicle in the best spot for excellent sightings and clicks.He infact predicted that a lion and lioness sleeping in the sun would mate...we witnessed the mating after waiting patiently for an hour and half.God Bless Patrick for making our trip so memorable and special.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sightings - The Big Five , a Leopard with a kill. Lions mating, Hippos,Crorcs, Zebras, Giraffes, Deers , Jackals, Wilder beasts, Warthogs, Ostrich , Flamingos and plenty of other birds and even a Turtle at Masai Mara.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kenya - Modern Nairobi , breathtaking countryside, awesome Parks ,Reserves and wilderness and amazing people with smiling faces all around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks Saran Vaid and Team The Earth Safari for everything....Look forward to travelling with you again.</p>

								<p><strong>Top Notch Safari Company - 100% Recommend for a World Class Safari and Experience</strong></p>
<p>I recently went on a last minute expedition to Ranthambhore National Park to photograph tigers. Because my decision was so last minute (a week before I was due to leave), I was doubtful that there would be any safari spots available. However, after speaking with perhaps the most professional and helpful person ever, Saran, he was able to quickly arrange safaris, hotels, transfers within just a few hours. I was elated. But it got better. After speaking with Saran about my intentions for my expedition, he went above and beyond to try and find ways to get me into particular zones of interest. These are highly sought after zones and require 90 days of pre-planning to ensure you can get into them, but somehow Saran was able to get me into them about 80% of the time. It was perhaps the best travel experience I have had to date (and I have been all over the world) so if you are looking for a world class/first class experience, I highly recommend using The Earth Safari. You WILL NOT be disappointed! Thanks again Saran. You and your team made my expedition beyond enjoyable and when I come back to India, I will be sure to contact you again (this time, much more in advance :)</p>							</div>

								<p>Dear Saran, Many thanks for arranging our trip to Tanzania! It was a trip of many superlatives for the savannah and wilderness. We are really enjoyed the vastness of Serengeti and Crater. The real highlight was the way wild animals approaching the human race as not a threat was amazing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Stay and food at Arusha was excellent. The place was really awesome!</p>
<p>&bull; Escarpment property at Manyara was excellent, well trained team and meticulously executed Guest services. Food was a delight!</p>
<p>&bull; Ngorongoro Serengeti was an exclusive property and well maintained rooms and facilities. Good food here!</p>
<p>&bull; Our driver George is a well-read, informative and helpful person</p>
<p>&bull; Serengeti Serena was a good place to stay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had a great first trip to Tanzania and look forward to visiting again going forward.</p>
<p>Sorry about the delayed feedback as I have been in and out of Chennai travelling on work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for meticulously planning a great trip for us.</p>

								<p>It was a pleasant &amp; easy experience booking with &lsquo;The Earth Safari&rsquo; for our visit to Kenya in June. The response from Saran was prompt, the itinerary was fully customised for our needs, budget &amp; the entire trip definitely offered great value. We had no problems whatsoever reaching Saran at anytime for certain last minute changes in the itinerary due to our flight being cancelled. Our guide/driver, Dominic, deserves a special mention as he was a true professional through &amp; through, making sure that we had great sightings. Would definitely recommend booking with &lsquo;The Earth Safari&rsquo; &amp; will make sure to book again for our next trip to Kenya or Tanzania.</p>

								<p>Dear Saran,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wife , Mala &amp; I got back almost a fortnight back from Kenya after having had a wonderful &amp; memorable African Safari experience during which we saw all the African Big 5 animals. My sincere apologies for the delayed feedback, due to certain household priorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Mala , a cancer survivor , expressed her desire to visit Kenya for a wild life safari tour , I was certainly not comfortable with the destination idea since I had no information about any well known branded tour operator in India who could help us with arrangements for such a trip. I happened to hit upon your organization through the internet search . My first impression going through your website was not very exciting, nor did the few exchange of e-mails add to any further excitement. I was feeling a little lost on what to do next!</p>
<p>It was only when Mala &amp; I visited your office &amp; met you, that I felt a lot more comfortable &amp; confident of making the Kenya trip happen, for my wife&rsquo;s sake .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You came out to be a thoroughly knowledgeable professional who knew the wild life subject as a good master and yet you were so humble &amp; specific to the point in all your communications (without any bragging whatsoever !!). You had lots of patience to answer my numerous questions related to my wife&rsquo;s comfort during the safari trip &amp; also related to general security concerns in Kenya .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To summarise our feedback on the 5N / 6D Safari trip during 27th September ~ 02nd October, 2015 covering Amboseli, Lake Naivasha &ndash; Lake Nakuru and Masai Mara, I wish to state the following :-</p>
<p>1. Everything in the trip was as what was committed by you &amp; no statement was exaggerated.</p>
<p>2. Your partner in Kenya, Nairobi managed all the package arrangements professionally taking care of all inter &ndash; venue travels and the hotel stays at Sopa Lodges.</p>
<p>3. Not only did they take care of &ldquo; meet &amp; greet &ldquo; arrangements on our arrival at Nairobi on 27th September, one of their employees Ms. Joyce also took personal care to even see us off at the airport on 03rd October.</p>
<p>4. The Driver &ndash; Guide assigned to us, Mr. John Kimani was very knowledgeable and it was always very interesting to listen to his wild life commentary during the game drives.</p>
<p>5. Very cost effective &amp; certainly value for money package. Finally , Mala joins me in thanking you and your team for a truly amazing experience , which we never expected to be as good as what it turned out to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also need to thank you for making the arrangements for our visit to the Giraffe Centre &amp; for the dining experience at the Carnivore Restaurant at Nairobi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With our best wishes for your continued success,</p>

								<p>Hello Saran,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are a Much-Delighted group after experiencing a memorable and enriching trip to Tanzania earlier this month thanks entirely to the meticulous organization and execution of our customized itinerary by you and your excellent team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was really good to speak to you personally as soon as we returned and convey our appreciation and gratitude for services rendered to us during our holiday. From the moment we landed at JRO, Mr. Umari and Mr. Hussain took over the responsibility of being our wonderful guides and remained dedicated to their mission of satisfying our needs and desires throughout the trip till we were seen off at JRO. They were always punctual, courteous, ever-smiling despite long days behind the wheels and explained to us the flora and fauna in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, the Serengeti National Park and the Lake Manyara National Park which enabled us to learn and appreciate the sceneries, the animal kingdom and the local human inhabitation. We are extremely satisfied with their services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We thank you for selecting Mbalageti Tented Chalets for our stay in Western Serengeti which was a very unique experience for all of us. The location, the luxury amenities amidst ethnic setting, personal security (a Maasai with torch and spear) for each guest within the resort at night time, courteous hospitality of the entire staff and the fantastic food served on verandahs overlooking the vast valley made it very relaxing and soothing after the game drives making us look forward to the next morning with eagerness and excitement. The Serena Lodges, each in its own special way, set amidst coffee estates overlooking the Lake Duluti, stone-walled at the edge of Ngorongoro Crater Rim and circular cottages overlooking the Lake Manyara were also superb in providing us with comfortable relaxing rooms, pristine surroundings and excellent food suited to our herbivore habits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To summarise, as a family, we've had an unforgettable holiday, with treasured memories of time spent together, enjoying the migration of wildebeests and zebras, the game drives, the rustic dusty rides, the sightings of animals (including a kill-action in its last moments), the stay, the food, the hospitality and the courtesy extended to each one of us. You have a wonderful team that manages so well and believes in customer satisfaction. I will share with you some good photo shoots from our collection once I get from all members and compile the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wishing you the very best always,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<p>Hi Saran,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apologies for the delay in writing this mail,it's long overdue. I got real busy after my return.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well here goes.. Kenya was breathtaking. Rohaan and I just had the most beautiful time together and I think it will be a trip we will remember all our lives. It was special as it was the first time my son whose 4 and I travelled alone together so the quality time overseas especially a place like Africa was an experience that's hard to put into words.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the camps you booked us in were beautiful and just what I had wanted for this trip. The food was impeccable EVERYWHERE! I don't remember eating any average meals,it was great for the both of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was also very peaceful and quite as most places Rohan and I were the only guests but it worked wonderfully for me since I don't like seeing too many people anyway :D.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We felt like it was our own private camp.There was also enough alone time and quite time in between game drives for me to sit by myself and read a nice book with a glass of wine whilst R slept, so the trip was also relaxing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The staff was truly wonderful everywhere( I mean that) but especially Sand river Masai and Larsens at Samburu. They pampered us and Rohaan made lots of friends with the sweet folk who worked there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He still talks about Qasim( sand river) and Krisia( at Samburu who he played with everyday) not to mention Bastone our guide. He was great company.Rohaan and me enjoyed chatting with him on our long drives from one park to the other. He was very information and R truly got into the spirit of knowing more about the wildlife( asked lots of questions)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your Kenyan partners did a wonderful job too, infact the lunch and chat on the last day with their representatives was real sweet :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2 ladies Manisha and im so sorry but I don't remember that other lovely ladies name but she was so great she made sure we found ALL the hidden shopping places I had on my wish list for Nairobi and thanks to her numerous phone calls to get directions( she was with us the last day at Nairobi) I was able to shop for some gorgeous things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have so many touching memories and it's had to pen them all down but we both wanted to say Thank you so much, you did a wonderful job and we hope we can do a trip like this again real soon :)).</p>

								<p>We were travelling in a group of 12 people of varying ages and had the honour to be travelling with His Highness the Maharaja of Kolhapur and his wife maharani saheb. Having taken the initiative of planning the trip, we were a bit anxious of the service by The Earth safari, India (Saran Vaid). But they surpassed our expectations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Guides were there on arrival. We have two brand new 4x4s. They had promised us the best cars and drivers guides from what we believe is a pool of more than 280 drivers! the luggage just about fits and since the inside has 8 seats .we were very comfortable .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They drive us to Arusha town which I presumed was close but it takes us over an hour from the airport..after a sumptuous lunch at Arusha Hotel we leave for Tarangire national park. We were met by their manager who briefed us on the entire trip and was extremely prompt in calling me during the safari in case of any minor changes etc. The Guide / drivers Musa And Saturo are extremely polite and well mannered.we spent 8 days with both of them. They are both extremely knowledgeable about the game and plant species.Between the 3 parks we saw over 100 lions , 2 leopards on trees,rhinos ,elephants scores of wildebeest, zebras dik diks grants gazelles impalas hippos giraffes we were lucky to witness a live kill by a leopard . Musa and Saturo were always very enthusiastic to show us game and untiringly drive us around.I think we enjoyed the game drives due to your willingness to please.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were very sad to say goodbye to them at the Serengeti serenora airstrip for our flight link to Zanzibar. The flight was a 12 seated and very pleasant.somit was almost like a charter flight. Zanzibar was interesting ,though the spice tour was a bit of a let down..we enjoyed the carved doors tour.Zanzibar felt like a bit of Marrakech ,maybe India? Africa...confusing, but full of surprises!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All over the Sopa lodges in three game parks were exceptional in terms of quality and service..maybe the earth safari had taken special care and staff was very warm and helpful. we especially appreciated the special surprises,they had coordinated with the hotels ,the sundowners at the rim of the Ngorongoro crater ,the bush breakfast at Serengeti were all highlights of the trip and I guess this is what makes a trip memorable and special.The rooms were with splendid views and we were upgraded in lake manyara to kiruruma manyara lodge at no extra cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The food throughout was top class with 5 course meals and a bit of Indian cuisine if anyone missed it.The head chef would ask us for any special preferences and at Serengeti Sopa lodge ,he especially cooked a delicious leg of lamb, a vindaloo amongst other delicacies. We thank The Earth Safari for making Tanzanian safari such a pleasurable trip.I am sure there will be a lot of friends who will want to use your services after our experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you. Pravinsinh and Nandita Ghatge. Kolhapur India.</p>							</div>

								<p>Hello Saran, Here's some feedback from our trip to the Masai Mara.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Earth Safari: Very knowledgeable, patiently answered questions from first-time visitors like me, and professional in approach. Their representatives in Nairobi were also very helpful. When our flight from NBO to EBB got cancelled, they made arrangements in another flight a few hours later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Camp: Staff extremely courteous and friendly. The morning after we landed, they took care of Child Care arrangements while we went for the Balloon Safari. They went out of the way to make us comfortable. We had a wonderful guide Lucas, who showed us big game every time he took us out. He had a knack of spotting game camouflaged in the Masai Mara. The manager of the camp also made it a point to chat with us every time and find out if everything was fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will refer The Earth Safari to my friends who are looking for an African adventure. Will be in touch.</p>							</div>

								<p>We 4 (my wife and 2 kids) started our journey to our dream destination, Kenya on 6th of June from Singapore. The Trip was planned via Dubai. Our itinerary includes two days stay in Dubai and we were suppose to take the flight from Dubai to Kenya on 9th of June morning. The weather in Dubai was very bad (46C) which has resulted in my little daughter falling sick. We were suppose to take our flight to Kenya on the next day. On the morning of 8th June, we had taken her to the doctor and he has advised us to postpone the travel by a day as it is not safe to travel. As the entire trip was planned from 9th June, we were very disappointed. Thats when I called Saran, the director of The Earth Safari, and briefed him about the situation. After listening to me carefully, he said, "don't worry, give me sometime, I will call you back in a hour". I was anxious as I was not sure whether it is possible to change the entire schedule by a day. His words gave me confidence and as promised, indeed he called me back in 30 minutes and confirmed that i could change my date. His call has turned our frown upside down :-). Thank you Saran.!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We reached Nairobi on the early morning of 10th June. After the immigration formalities and little bit freshening up from the airport, we took the exit gate. The representative from the earth safari Mr Peter, was waiting outside to receive us. He gave us the briefing about our itinerary and also introduced to our Driver and Guide Mr Newton. Our destination for day 1 was Amboseli National Park. The journey from Airport to the park was very good. On the way, we were thrilled to see the Zebra, followed by Wildebeest and Giraffes. Our excitement reached its peak, when we saw the first herd of elephant before we reached our lodge. The stay in Amboseli Serene lodge was simply amazing. The facilities, ambience, food as well as the friendly staffs gave us a sense of home outside home. The lodge was situated just in the middle of the safari and we could see freely roaming wild animals if we step out of our room. The morning and evening safari rides were simply great and we could sight various animals such as a number of elephant herds, Impala, Hyena, Zebra, Wildebeest, Lion and Giraffe. Even though we could not see the lion very closely, Newton has promised that he could take us closer to them at Masai Mara.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the morning of Day3, we had started our journey to our next destination, Lake Nakuru where we stayed in Sarova Lion Hill lodge which is again another amazing lodge. It was an 6 hour journey and we could reach there only around 3.30 PM. After our late lunch, we all got into the van for the safari ride where we saw, plenty of flamingos, white Rhino and a group of Giraffes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Day 4 after break fast, we all said good bye to Nakuru and started our journey to our final destination Masai Mara!!!. It took about 6 and half hours for us to reach Masai Mara. The journey never gave us any boredom, thanks to the beautiful landscape and the wealth of wildlife. The stay in Masai Mara was at Keekorok which is another world class lodge, again in the middle of the safari. After lunch and a small break, we started our game drive at 4. The first sight was a herd of elephants followed by a leopard on a Tree. It was an amazing sight. The landscape in Masai Mara was different from Amboseli. Newton did not break his promise, we have managed to see many lions, elephants, Cheetah, Black Rhino and of course, Zeebra, Wildebeest as well as Giraffes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, it was indeed a memorable trip for all of us. We really enjoyed it and it would continue to be in our memory for the rest of our life. Thank you Saran. Will come back to you again once we decide our next safari destination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

								<p>Being wildlife enthusiasts and having visited many of the National Parks in India, we planned a trip to Kenya. A small group of six, we contacted many tour operators and were not satisfied till we spoke to Saran Vaid of The Earth Safari. A wildlife photographer, he immediately understood our requirements and finalised a tailor made plan for a week which fitted perfectly with our budget and plan. We visited Maasai mara Reserve, Lake Nakaru Mational Park and Amboseli National Park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We stayed at Sarova Mara at Maasai Mara, Sarova Lion HIll Lodge at Lake Nakaru and Amboseli Serena at Amboseli. All the properties arranged by The Earth Safari were located well within the Parks and had top class accomodation and food including Indian cuisine. Right from the time we landed at Nairobi airport on 15 May 2014 and till we left for India on 21 May 2014, everything was organised with clockwork precision. We had an excellent and knowledgeable tour guide, Joshua who ensured that we get to see the best of the wildlife. We did see four of the big five, except the elusive leopard. We saw plenty of birds and animals including the rare sights of a male lion with its kill(a buffalo) and two lions mating. Another memorable sight was two tuskers fighting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, it was our best game viewing trip, amazingly well organized and beyond expectations. 'Asante Sana' Saran Vaid and The Earth Safari for a wonderful and memorable trip.</p>							</div>

								<p>My family and I went on a week's trip to Kenya between 15th to 22nd February, 2014 through The Earth Safari.</p>
<p>Saran Vaid's approach was very friendly since the start. Had a good briefing regarding the trip and he patiently answered all my questions right from the start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TRIP was perfectly planned by his team. The whole trip was customised according to how I wanted. We happened to see a lion hunt a cow very next to our van the moment we entered Amboseli national park. We had a thrilling and exciting experience. Cheetahs walked literally next to our van. Had loads and loads of adrenaline rush. Lake Nakuru and masai were awesome. Saw all the big five. Happened to be just few feets away from predators. Have been to more than 24 countries in the past. But this is the best experience I had. We were provided with indian food as we requested. Our game guide was humble and took efforts to show us a wide variety of wildlife ( more than 40 species!!) stay was pleasant within the national park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accidentally saw this website online. Very very happy and satisfied to have booked this trip through The Earth Safari. No regrets at all. Our family is already planning for a trip to Tanzania through theearthsafari in 2015. Thank u SARAN and team for giving me this unforgettable experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>							</div>

								<p>We've just returned from a spectacular and memorable 12 day trip to Rwanda,Kenya and Tanzania all arranged meticulously by The Earth Safari.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mails to Saran Vaid always brought in prompt replies. There were many discussions (email and phone) and although we chopped and changed the itinerary a bit, Vaid forbore with us very patiently and managed to incorporate the requested changes although it was peak season. From the gorilla permits to being met at the airports and dropped off at Nairobi airport, everything was taken care of for us. Our son and fiancee joined us from New York and when their flight from NYC was cancelled (horror of horrors), alternative arrangements in Kigali were quickly put in place by Vaid. Vaid's ground agent in Rwanda even came over to meet us to ensure everything was ok which was a great thing to do! All pick-ups and transfers especially at the Isebania and Namanga borders were smooth and on time.</p>
<p><br /> <br />Accomodation in Kenya and Tanzania was an excellent mix of lodges and camps. From Lake Nakuru lodge where we were given rooms with a spectacular view of the savannah to the Fig tree camp in Mara on the banks of the Talek, to the Kati Kati tented camp in the Serengeti where hyenas whooped their way in the night and we even heard a lion in the early morning, to the Ngorongoro wildlife lodge with spectacular views of the crater, to Osupuko lodge in a breathtakingly serene setting overlooking Tarangire with its ebullient manager David and staff ( all Maasai), we encountered warm hospitality throughout &nbsp;And the food was great!</p>
<p><br /> <br />Driver guides especially in Rwanda and Kenya were superb. Simon by his own admission knows Mara like the back of his hand and it certainly showed. "Where are the lions? We'll find them<br />no matter what !" -that about summed up Simon's dedication . We saw the most amazing things:<br /> <br />Not one but four lion hunts at close quarters (2 successful),</p>
<p><br />4 cheetahs hunting , a cheetah gorging on its kill and throwing up, several lion prides., 2 leopards on a tree...................</p>
<p><br />The finally tally stood at over 60 lions, 8 cheetah, 2 leopards, a million wildebeest, elephants galore,white and black rhinos ,buffaloes ,zebra ,giraffe, birds- you name it - we saw them all. Not in our wildest dreams had we expected anything of the kind.It was like being on Discovery live.</p>
<p><br /> <br />And gorilla tracking in Rwanda proved to be a once-in-a lifetime experience. We were assigned the Ntambara group of 12 gorillas which included 2 silverbacks. One silverback made straight for my son who promptly squatted with his head bent down and the Silverback gently moved its arm across his back twice! <br /> <br />A hot balloon ride and Maasai village visit rounded off the tour.</p>
<p><br /> <br />Thank you Mr.Vaid for a most memorable and enjoyable safari !</p>

								<p>My Husband and I would like to thank everyone at The Earth Safari for all the work that was done to organize and coordinate our recent Tiger safari at Ranthambore National Reserve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Krishan, you in particular were very helpful in planning our itinerary that made our adventure one of the best experiences in our lives. An important factor in choosing The Earth Safari was the quick response to my inquiry and great internet communication during the planning process. All of our needs were addressed and the outcome couldn't have been better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hotel recommendation of the Oberoi Vanyavilas was a jewel. The tented vilas provided the ambiance of a true safari experience and at the same time provided 5-star amenities. The staff was courteous and friendly. The food was delicious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Guide and driver you provided went out of their way to make our jeep safari informative and most important got good results. Saw beautiful Tigers on both days. The pictures that I took of Tigress, Noor licking her cub, Sultan are priceless. We are extremely happy to have visited the Park and seen Tiger wildlife in their natural habitat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will also cherish these memories forever and will encourage other fellow travelers to consider a journey into the wilderness at Ranthambore National Park. The Earth Safari will be at the top of our list of recommendation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, all of our transfers went extremely well. Most appreciated was the assistance by you and your staff in helping us with our luggage. Never could have made it without you! In closing, we once again want to thank you for a wonderful vacation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to working with you again when we return to India.</p>

								<p>My wife and me, we enjoyed all the game drives. One was special. We were together with a group of Indian students. Like we, they had interest to everything: all kind of animals, the park itself, the trees and more. We stopped often and took our time also to watch birds and crocodiles, dears, antelopes, parrots, monkeys, Eagles and many other! We not wanted to return without exciting pictures. For them, it was the first game drive, for us the third. We have been happy to have all this nice pictures and that we have seen those animals live in their territory, because the drive would end shortly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then, we have seen an instruction hunt: a Female Tiger (Noor) observed the "hunt" of her son (Sultan). It was amazing. better than a real hunt: All happened slower and the deer run quite slowly away: no dust and time to look. Great! The first, and the second drive have been good. But we had a couple in the car who wanted absolutely to see the Tiger. They missed a lot! And we as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fourth drive was that one, where we not have seen much. Four students came from several hundred kilometers away to just see the tiger. No other interest. They made one photo: the group and the car. We didn't complain, because we have seen tigers and so many exciting animal, that we not wanted to miss them the chance. To book only one game drive is not a good idea when you are fixed on seeing tigers and nothing else!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The guide and the driver gave their best to find the tiger by following his many steps in the sandy road. We have been for two nights at Regency hotel. Just great!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you a lot for this great experience in India to Saran and his great team!</p>							</div>

								<p>Hello Saran, Just a few words of praise! In trying to coordinate a rather ambitious 11 days wildlife adventure to Northern Tanzania,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I contacted several tour companies and travel agents. Saran Vaid of theearthsafaris.com (office in New Delhi) was the most helpful and responsive in helping me plan my trip to Lake Manyara, Serengeti, Ngorongoro and Taringere. He coordinated the hotels, transportation, safari for the entire trip and all went off without a hitch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't thank Saran enough for my wonderful vacation and his planning. Thanks to the guide NOVA, I had an exceptional time. He met me at the airport and was my private guide/ driver for the entire safari. I was impressed by my guide's patience and spotting of wildlife. I swear he can spot wildlife with his eyes closed. Nova was very knowledgeable about the geography, flora and animals along the entire safari.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all an excellent smooth safari, and I will be contacting Saran for my next adventure to Africa!&nbsp;</p>							</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My itinerary was fully packed and for the money, no one could compete. You have been incredibly helpful, responded to emails very quickly and always available on the phone to talk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout the trip, I was accommodated with superior lodging with decent security, fine food, and quality services, along with comfortable vehicles. Both guides have in-depth knowledge of animal behaviors and multi- year of field experiences, thus I was able to view all the Big Five . These sightings would not be possible if were not their dedication and drives for excellence. I met James at Nairobi airport who came to receive me and brief me about my stay there. I honestly couldn't find a fault with anything over the 2 weeks. In particular my guides Joshua and Abdalah really made my trip extra special.They were extremely knowledgeable about all the animals and could really tell that they wanted me to have the best time (which I did!). They were really great guys . They both always ensured I had prime vantage points for wildlife viewing and were knowledgeable on all aspects of African wildlife. Apart from my passion for wildlife, it is the dedication and pride that they both have in their work which makes me decide to return to Kenya and Tanzania for a second visit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only disappointment for me was not being able to stay out there for a few more days!! I can't speak highly enough of this company and the fantastic people who work for it. Here, I want to thank You and the guides for giving me a memory that will last through my lifetime.</p>

								<p>Hi, we had booked a wildlife tour with The Earth Safari to Ranthambore and Central India and the services provided to us were very good. We had a very good driver, who really made our trip very special.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lodges provided were excellent. We had excellent tiger sightings in most parks, thanks to the naturalists chosen at all national parks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The price was quoted to us was very reasonable. All our travel arrangements were confirmed well in advance by Krishan Kumar and we had a very nice trip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will recommend The Earth Safari to all our friend and relatives, who want to visit India.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
